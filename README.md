  - No Amount of Testing Can prove no bugs from ISTQB, "Testing can shows the presence of defects: Testing can show that defects are present, but cannot prove that there are no defects". Since you could always be "missing one test" that *would* fail because of the bug in the system. If you can show that you have covered all situatinos with tests (a somewhat impossible goal) *and* all of those tests are passing then you can indeed be certain that that the software is absent of bugs. It's sort of a cop-out answer though, since the next question is, "well how do we know if we are missing certain tests?". Sometimes you can't foresee them, and you retrospectively write the tests to expose the bugs, but sometimes the missing or incorrect tests stem frmo not fully understand the requirements in the first place.
